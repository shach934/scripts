It can be beneficial to start the solution with a first-order numerical scheme.
As discussed in the section on judging convergence, the dissipative errors resulting from first-order solutions are stabilizing and can enhance convergence. Therefore, it can be beneficial to start the solution with a first-order numerical scheme. For example:

• Models involving convective transport equations have either a Convection property (for segregated
models), or a Discretization property (for the Coupled Flow model), that can be set to first order. The
Convection property for segregated models affects only the upwind scheme for convection, leaving the
diffusion and other gradients still fully second-order. The Discretization property for the Coupled Flow
model neglects higher-order reconstruction for convection and diffusion.

• Solvers that are related to models that involve convective transport equations have a Reconstruction
Zeroed expert property. Irrespective of the model type, this property causes reconstruction gradients to be
neglected, effectively resulting in a first-order scheme.
